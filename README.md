# Rails Social — A Full-Stack Social Media Web Application

[Click here](https://rails-social-app.onrender.com) to checkout the application deployed on Render! (currently down)

This is a full-stack social media web application built with **Ruby on Rails 8**, **Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
It allows users to create posts, follow others, like and comment on content, and manage their profiles — all within a clean and responsive interface.

This project was built as part of the [Ruby on Rails curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails) from **The Odin Project**, and serves as a capstone to demonstrate what I’ve learned about Rails, full-stack development, and modern web design.

## What I Learned

This project helped me bring together everything I’ve learned so far about full-stack web development in Rails. It also pushed me to explore areas where I had less experience (particularly in JavaScript) and adopt a learn-as-you-go mindset.

Some of the key takeaways include:

- Using **Hotwire and Turbo** to create dynamic, real-time features without a heavy JavaScript frameworks.

- Structuring a Rails app with **clear model relationships** and RESTful routes.

- Managing authentication, authorization, and profile editing with **Devise**.

- Designing a **consistent, user-friendly interface** with reusable CSS components.

## Future Improvements

There are several improvements and extensions I would like to work on next:

- A dark mode theme

- Photo uploads in posts

- More profile personalisation features (bio, social links, etc.)

- Chat rooms / direct messaging

- Smarter content organisation and recommendation algorithms
